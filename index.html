    <h1>What do you think back-end developers do?
</h1>
<p>Back-end developers work hand-in-hand with front-end developers by providing the outward facing web application elements server-side logic. In other words, back-end developers create the logic to make the web app function properly, and they accomplish this through the use of server-side scripting languages like Ruby or PHP</p>

<p>Aside from making web applications functional, back-end developers are also responsible for optimizing the application for speed and efficiency. Moreover, back-end developers often create a data storage solution with a database, which is a crucial component for all web applications since it stores information (like users, comments, posts, etc.). Common databases include MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.</p>

<h3>Responsibilities of a back-end developer can include working with:</h3>
<p>- Database creation, integration, and management <br>
- Back-end frameworks to build server-side software <br>
- Web server technologies <br>
- Cloud computing integration <br>
- Server-side programming languages <br>
- Operating systems <br>
- Content management system development, deployment, and maintenance <br>
- API integration <br>
- Security settings and hack prevents <br>
- Reporting—generating analytics and statistics <br>
- Backup and restore technologies for a website’s files and DB

<h1>Write What You know about HTTP?
</h1>
<p>
   <b>HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol </b>
<br><br>Communication between client computers and web servers is done by sending HTTP Requests and receiving HTTP Responses
</p>
<h4>  HTTP Request / Response</h4>
<p>Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:<br>
<br>
1.	A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web <br>
2.	An web server receives the request  <br>
3.	The server runs an application to process the request <br>
4.	The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser <br>
5.	The client (the browser) receives the response <br>

<h1>Why use a database?</h1>
<p>•	Databases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up little space).
<br>•	It is very quick and easy to find information.
<br>•	It is easy to add new data and to edit or delete old data.
<br>•	Data can be searched easily, eg 'find all Ford cars'.
<br>•	Data can be sorted easily, for example into 'date first registered' order.
<br>•	Data can be imported into other applications, for example a mail-merge letter to a customer saying that an MOT test is due.
<br>•	More than one person can access the same database at the same time - multi-access.
<br>•	Security may be better than in paper files.
